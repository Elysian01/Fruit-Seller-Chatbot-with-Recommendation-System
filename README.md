## Install dependencies

```bash
pip install rasa
```
Installation docs: https://rasa.com/docs/rasa/installation/

Create a new python environment
```bash
conda create --name rasa python==3.6
```

Install all the requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Import SQL database "fruit_rasa" to your local server (Xampp)

Optional Installation
```bash
pip install rasa-x
```

**Import and setup the Mysql database**

## Run the bot

Use `rasa train` to train a model.

Then, to run, first set up your action server in one terminal window:
```bash
rasa run actions
```

In another window, run the following command to talk to the bot:
```
rasa shell --debug
```

Note that `--debug` mode will produce a lot of output meant to help you understand how the bot is working
under the hood. To simply talk to the bot, you can remove this flag.


You can also try out your bot locally using Rasa X by running
```
rasa x
```
